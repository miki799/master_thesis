# Kubernetes Network Policies follow a "deny by default" model.
# So what is not specified here will by denied (e.g. from inside Pods we cannot send requests to the API server)

# Following NetworkPolicy concerns dev namespace and allows:
# alpine-dev -> nginx
# alpine-dev -> vuln-app
# every-pod-in-dev-namespace -> k8s dns service in kube-system namespace
