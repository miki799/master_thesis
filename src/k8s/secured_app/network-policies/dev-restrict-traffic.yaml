# Kubernetes Network Policies follow a "deny by default" model.
# So what is not specified here will by denied (e.g. from inside Pods we cannot send requests to the API server)
# Following NetworkPolicy concerns dev namespace and allows:

# alpine-dev -> nginx
# nginx <- alpine-dev
# alpine-dev -> CoreDNS
# vuln-app - only external access through NodePort
